### 1. Install the `gh-pages` npm package to the react-app

1. Install the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) npm package and designate it as a [development dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file):
 
    ```shell
    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

At this point, the `gh-pages` npm package is installed on your computer and the React app's dependence upon it is documented in the React app's `package.json` file.

### 2. Add a `homepage` property to the `package.json` file

1. Add a `homepage` property in this format\*: `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

    > \* For a [project site](https://pages.github.com/#project-site), that's the format. For a [user site](https://pages.github.com/#user-site), the format is: `https://{username}.github.io`. You can read more about the `homepage` property in the ["GitHub Pages" section](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) of the `create-react-app` documentation.

    ```diff
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "0.1.0",
    + "homepage": "https://gitname.github.io/repo-name",
      "private": true,
    ```
At this point, the React app's `package.json` file includes a property named `homepage`.

### 3. Add deployment scripts to the `package.json` file

1. Open the `package.json` file in a text editor (if it isn't already open in one).
   
    ```shell
    $ vi package.json
    ```

2. Add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property to the `scripts` object:

    ```diff
    "scripts": {
    +   "predeploy": "npm run build",
    +   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build",
    ```

At this point, the  React app's `package.json` file includes deployment scripts.

### 4. Push the React app to the GitHub repository

1. Push the React app to the GitHub repository

    ```shell
    $ npm run deploy
    ```

    > That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.
    >
    > Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.

    > By default, the new commit on the `gh-pages` branch will have a commit message of "Updates". You can [specify a custom commit message](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/issues/80#issuecomment-1042449820) via the `-m` option, like this:
    > ```shell
    > $ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
    > ```

At this point, the GitHub repository contains a branch named `gh-pages`, which contains the files that make up the distributable version of the React app. However, we haven't configured GitHub Pages to _serve_ those files yet.

### 5. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Navigate to the **GitHub Pages** settings page
   1. In your web browser, navigate to the GitHub repository
   1. Above the code browser, click on the tab labeled "Settings"
   1. In the sidebar, in the "Code and automation" section, click on "Pages"
1. Configure the "Build and deployment" settings like this: 
   1. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   2. **Branch**: 
      - Branch: `gh-pages`
      - Folder: `/ (root)`
1. Click on the "Save" button
